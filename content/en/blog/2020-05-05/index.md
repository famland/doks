### **Airdrop quota: 500,000 YL (including the market-making allocation quota for subscribing the original field whitelist)**

### **Event Time: May 5, 2022 20:00  ---  May 8, 2022 20:00 (UTC+8)   72 hours**



Famland's original fields are plots with certain risk farming benefits, but they are also the most profitable ones. Users can make markets in Famland's original fields only if they have obtained the original field market-making qualification whitelist. **When the project is launched, the YLE community will arrange a 72-hour whitelist-free open market-making period. After the open market-making period ends, no more open market-making opportunities will be arranged permanently. In the future, market making in Famland original field will only be possible after obtaining the original field market-making qualification whitelist. **



### **Advantages of original field market making**

The original field is a venture capital land on Famland, so it has the highest return.

According to the investment of 500 USDT into the original field, the system will automatically allocate YL worth 500 USDT to form a USDT/YL LP and deposit it in the fund pool. That is, if you deposit 500 USDT, the profit will be calculated according to the market making principal of 2000 USDT. If Famland planted Cryptotree, the total farming income will increase by another 33%, and the income will be calculated based on the market making principal of 3000 USDT.



## There is only one chance to make a market in the original field without whitelisting, don't miss it!



### **Activity 1:**

**During the activity, all home buyers who have successfully created a Famland can deposit market making funds in the original field. The original field market making funds of each Famland NFT can deposit a minimum of 100 USDT and a maximum of 500 USDT . **

After the deposit is successful, the YLE system will automatically transfer the same amount of YL from the original field market-making capital account at 1:1 according to the amount of UDST deposited to form USDT+YL LP and deposit it into the liquidity pool.

>For example, if a home buyer deposits 500USDT, the system automatically allocates 500YL airdrops, the original field market making capital is 500USDT+500YL, which is equivalent to 1000 USDT, and the farming income will be calculated as 2000 USDT.

>### **What is the original field market making whitelist? **

>Famland's original fields are plots with certain risk farming benefits, but they are also the most profitable ones. Users can make markets in Famland's original fields only if they have obtained the original field market-making qualification whitelist. When the project is launched, the YLE community will arrange a 72-hour whitelist-free open market-making period**. After the open market-making time is over, no open market-making opportunities will be arranged permanently. In the future, market making in Famland original field will only be possible after obtaining the original field market-making qualification whitelist. **



### **Original field market making whitelist acquisition:**

### **Pre-launch stage of the project:**

Participate in the whitelist pre-sale activity of original feild market making, the activity will end at 20:00 on May 5, 2022 (UTC+8)

Activity address:

https://www.famland.world/docs/activities/buy-oiginal-field-whitename-airdrop/

In the pre-launch stage of the project, if you subscribe to the original field whitelist, you will have the opportunity to receive YL and Babaoshu airdrop rewards.

Home buyers who have subscribed to the original field whitelist before the project launch, if they miss the opportunity to deposit market-making funds in the original field, then after the fertility value of the Famland under their name reaches 600,000, there will be remaining original field market making places in YLE It is mentioned that the original field market making entrance will be reopened.



### **Post-launch phase of the project:**

After the project is launched, if the fertility value of the Famland under the EOS account reaches 600,000, on the premise that YLE has the remaining original field market making places, the home buyer will automatically obtain the original field market making whitelist, and can directly make the market in the original field.

If the number of famlands whose monthly fertility value reaches 600,000 exceeds the number of market-making places in YLE's original fields, a queue will be held to compete for market-making places. Homebuyers can improve the market-making ranking by paying YL. The top-ranked Famland can complete the original field market-making, and the Famland that has not entered the valid ranking will continue to wait, and then continue to compete for the ranking market next month.

The number of Famland's original fields that can be marketed each month will be dynamically adjusted according to the increment of the famland's total fertility value of YLE's ecological. The number of market-making original fields each month will be announced when YLE's first Famland fertility value exceeds 600,000.



>### **What is the concept of Famland's fertility value reaching 600,000? **

>According to Famland's market making of a full-capacity basic field (250USDT+250YL), the fertility value can be increased to about 60,000 after continuous cultivation for about 45 days, then the fertility value can be increased to 600,000, and it takes about 450 days (15 months) of continuous cultivation. .



### **Investment Risk Warning:**

**The market-making funds invested by the user in the original field plot, once invested, can never be retrieved regardless of the success or failure of the project. **
