Due to the normal operation of the contract, if there is an unfarmed Famland, it cannot continue to create a new Famland. However, for the original field market making in the early stage of the project, this mechanism will restrict home buyers when making a market for multiple Famland original fields. It is now decided to temporarily adjust the contract (from May 2 to May 8, 2022) to : The maximum number of unfarmed Famland is 20, after the original field market making is completed, the number will be restored to the original mechanism.
