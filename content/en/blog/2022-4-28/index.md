Before original field market making, the community will transfer 500,000 YL from the 1.5 million YL airdrop account issued in the early stage to the special distribution fund account for original field market making. When each Famland deposits 500USDT in the original field, the contract will automatically transfer 500YL from the original field dedicated distribution fund account and deposit it into the farm fund pool together. After the original field market making ends, if there is still a balance in YL in the original field dedicated distribution bonus account, it will be transferred to the stable fund pool after the original field market making ends and before the basic field market making is opened.

When any of the following two conditions are met, the original field market making channel will be closed:

A. When the total market-making capital of orininal field reaches 500,000 USDT + 500,000 YL;

B. The original field market-making time exceeds the last cut-off time.
