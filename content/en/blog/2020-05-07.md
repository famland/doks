## **News---The first batch of 10,000 CryptoTrees have been issued**


A total of 600,000 Cryptotrees on the EOS public chain have been initialized! The first batch of 10,000 CryptoTrees have been released!

The 10,000 CryptoTrees that have been issued are managed by the community with multi-signature.
Therein:
> 1000 CryptoTrees are used for airdrop and development fund raising.
> 9000 CryptoTrees are reserved for future TRON (TRON) public chain CryptoTrees mapping exchange and distribution.

The distribution authority for the remaining 590,000 CryptoTrees has been granted to the farm contract, which will be issued according to the future CryptoTrees issuance rules.
