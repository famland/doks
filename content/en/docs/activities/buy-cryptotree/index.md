> **What is CryptoTree? What is the use of getting the Eight Treasure Tree?**
>
> CryptoTree is the first-generation NFT encrypted tree species of YLE ecology. After planting CryptoTree on Famland, it can activate the promotion channel of Famland's fertility value to automatically convert fertility bonus. At the same time, Famland directly increases the basic value of original fertility bonus by 100 %, in the future, the increased fertility value can be continuously converted into a fertility bonus, which will further amplify the efficiency of the market-making funds of Famland's original fields and basic fields, and produce more YL. It is equivalent to a direct increase of more than 33% in YL production.

> **Isn't it possible to get CryptoTree for free by increasing the fertility value after going online? Why do I have to spend 200USDT to subscribe CryptoTree before the project goes live?**
>
> The most direct role of CryptoTree at this stage is to increase the fertility bonus for Famland, at least increase the YL production by more than 33%.
>
> We analyze from two dimensions:

> **Cultivation benefit analysis**
>
> If you want to obtain the condition of free CryptoTree, you must increase the fertility value of Famland to more than 60,000. According to the rules of increasing fertility value, we calculate the market-making value of 500USDT in the basic field, and we need to keep the basic field market-making for 45 days or more to meet this condition. Although you can achieve the purpose of leading trees for free, but you also have to bear a certain time cost.
>
> **Then we calculate according to Famland's average APY1500% yield**
>
> **After 45 days, the accumulated income of this Famland=500\*200%\*1500%\*45/365≈1849.315YL**
>
> But if we plant the purchased CryptoTree directly on the Famland from the first day (it is not subject to the fertility value), so that the fertility bonus of the Famland is increased to 300%, we will calculate according to the above conditions, After 45 days, the cumulative income of this Famland=500*300%*1500%*45/365≈2773.973YL
>
> **The difference between planting trees in advance and not planting trees in advance is 2773.973-1849.315=924.6576YL (equivalent to earning back the purchase principal in about 10 days)**
>
> If we consider the effect of investing 500 USDT in the original field to make the market, the income gap between early planting and not planting CryptoTree will be larger, as follows:
>
> If you do not plant trees in advance, the cumulative income of Famland in 45 days = 1500*200%*1500%*45/365≈5547.945YL
>
> Planting trees in advance, 45 days cumulative income of Famland = 1500*300%*1500%*45/365≈8321.918YL
>
> **The difference between planting trees in advance and not planting trees in advance is 8321.918-5547.945=2773.973YL (equivalent to 3.24 days to earn back the purchase principal)**
>
> **According to the above algorithm analysis, the effect of obtaining CryptoTree to improve Famland's production capacity is very obvious. Just the increase in output value of Famland's cultivation for 45 days is far more than the amount of the purchase principal.**

> **Investment Value Analysis**
>
> A total of 600 CryptoTrees will be rewarded by the community for subscribing the original field market-making qualification, and 400 CryptoTrees will be used for public subscription. In addition, players can only obtain the CryptoTree by increasing the fertility value of Famland.
>
> Up to now, the community has publicly allocated 298 CryptoTrees, of which 188 are used by early Yuantian investment users to plant Famland, and basically will not enter the market for circulation, that is, there are only about 100 CryptoTrees that can be directly circulated in the market .
>
> After the project is launched, players who have subscribed for CryptoTree will not sell it in the market at a price lower than 200USDT. When the number of active players reaches more than 300-400, the 100 or so CryptoTree in circulation is far from enough for the market Digest, as players continue to grow and demand continues to increase, the market transaction price of each CryptoTree will only rise.
