### Play key points

**In view of the complexity of YLE's ecological mechanism and contracts far exceeding the same type of projects, there are some particularities in the gameplay, which need to be paid attention to.**

- Considering the complexity of the Famland project design, although the contract has been audited and repeatedly tested, there are still unknown risks. Each homebuyer's participation in the project is deemed to recognize and accept the risk, and should bear the risk brought by it. Consequences of loss. 
- Due to the project design, the YL quota that enters the distribution pool after issuance and circulation is dynamically adjusted according to the fertility value of the farm in the previous farming cycle (24 hours). The fertility value of a farming cycle, so all farms (including original farms and shared farms) will not generate income during the first farming cycle; the income output of the first farming cycle will be activated 24 hours after the project goes live .
- For farmers who create a shared farm, the recommended method of operation is to move the pre-loaded Famland into the shared farm just before the end of the farming cycle. That is: try to let Famland stay on the original farm until the end of the farming cycle to enjoy the benefits, so as to reduce the loss of unprofitable output after Famland moves to the shared farm until the end of the farming cycle;
- The contract will not perform real-time scanning of the attribute data of all farms, but will only count the attribute data of each farm. Therefore, all homebuyers need to click on Rebase on the homepage in each farming cycle, and manually register and download all Famland data to their farms. Note: Under the same EOS account, all Famland, no matter where they are distributed in any farm, only need to rebase once in each farming cycle.
- Announcement of farm contract parameters:
    
     > **Cultivation period:** 24 hours, countdown display on the DAPP homepage.
    
     > **Farm Shared Value:** It is updated when Famland enters and leaves the farm, or when the home buyer rebases the homepage and collects income.
    
     > **Farm Fertility Value:** Rebase for home buyers, update when receiving income.
    
     > **Distribution pool:** automatically updated every 1 hour.
    
     > **Flow rate:** the same as the cultivation cycle, automatically updated in 24 hours.
    
     > **APY Update:** Automatically update every 1 hour.
    
- One month after the official launch of the project is the trial operation period. During this period, when there is a serious capital flight incident during the actual operation of the project, the members of the community temporary self-government committee (who have participated in the contract account with multiple signatures) have the right to modify the SWAP contract without normal slippage. Point parameters and flow rate price parameters reduce the risk of capital flight. At the same time, the community development fund account reserves 10,000 USDT and 10,000 YL to deal with emergencies during the trial operation of the project.
- After the trial run period, any adjustment to contract rules and parameters must be voted by more than half of all participating home buyers before it can take effect and be implemented.
