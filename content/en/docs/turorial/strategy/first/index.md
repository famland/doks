### Gameplay key points

In view of YLE's comprehensive consideration of the ecological mechanism, the complexity of the contract is far more than that of similar projects, so there are some particularities in the gameplay, which need to be paid attention to.

- **Due to the complexity of the Famland project design, although the contract has been audited and repeatedly tested, there are still unknown risks. All home buyers participating in the project are deemed to recognize and accept the risk, and should bear the consequences of the loss caused by the risk.**

- In the project design, the amount of YL entering the distribution pool after issuance and circulation is dynamically adjusted according to the fertility value of the farm in the previous farming cycle (24 hours). Since there is no fertility value of the previous farming cycle, all farms (including native farms and shared farms) will not generate income in the first farming cycle; the income output of the first farming cycle will be launched when the project is launched Activate after 24 hours.

- Due to the needs of system data settlement, the last half hour of each farming cycle is the system settlement period. During this period, YLE's SWAP transaction service will be suspended. During the service suspension period, home buyers need to settle the current cycle's bonus within this period (30 minutes), and only the settled bonus can be collected in the next cycle. Expired and unsettled rewards will be withdrawn by the system and rolled back to the prize pool. The settled rewards will continue to accumulate until the collection operation is completed.

- For farmers who create a shared farm, the recommended operation is to move the pre-loaded Famland into the shared farm just before the end of the farming cycle. That is: try to let Famland stay on the original farm until the end of this farming cycle to enjoy the benefits, so as to reduce the loss of no-profit output after Famland moves to the shared farm until the end of this farming cycle.

- The smart contract will not scan the attribute data of all Famlands in real time, but will only count the attribute data of each farm. Therefore, each home buyer needs to click "Rebase" on the homepage in each farming cycle, and manually report all the data of Famland under the account to the farm. Note: Under the same EOS account, all Famlands, no matter where they are located, only need to click "Rebase" once in each farming cycle.

- Farm contract parameters announced:

  Farming  period: 24 hours, countdown display on the DAPP homepage.

  Farm Shared Value: It is updated when Famland enters and leaves the farm, or when the home buyer rebases on the homepage and collects income.

  Farm Fertility Value:  update when Rebase or receiving income.

  Distribution pool: data is updated in real time

  Flow rate: the same as the cultivation cycle, automatically updated in 24 hours.

  APY Update: Data is updated in real time.

- One month after the project is officially launched is the trial operation period. During this period, when there is a serious capital flight incident during the actual operation of the project, the members of the community temporary self-government committee (who have participated in the contract account with multiple signatures) have the right to modify the SWAP contract without constant slippage. parameters and flow rate price parameters to reduce the risk of capital flight. At the same time, the community development fund account reserves 10,000 USDT and 10,000 YL to deal with emergencies during the trial operation of the project.

- After the trial run period, any adjustment to contract rules and parameters must be voted by more than half of all participating home buyers before it can take effect and be implemented.
